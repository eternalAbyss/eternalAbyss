# Data Engineer | Computer Science Engineer | Data Science and Statistics Scholar

I am a Data Engineer looking forward to learn much new technologies and skills. So far I have amassed skills in Computer Programming, Web Development (Full -stack), Data Engineering, Data Science and Machine Learning (Still learning).

I am fond of learning new tech, applying the knowledge and create new stuffs with it. Though my entire collection might seem like something haphazard I have tried my best to keep it structured.

## Why new tech?

Well to answer this one must look back to the theory of evolution, we as a human race suffice the need of being the fittest among all other species and have ruled them by our magnificient technical brains and amazing craft skills. Would we have only been perfecting the legacy items without finding new ones, we would have been stuck in the caves only. Similarly for humans to go above and beyond exploration is compulsory and hence my interest in exploration of new tech.

## Why Machine Learning?

I am fascinated that a computer can learn like a human brain, though the efficiency is not good enough but the computing power is. It can be argued that machines make us(as a human capability) slower, but for me that's just an individual choice. ML will not take away jobs rather will let humans be more creative in their own way and do what they do the best, CREATE.

## Why me?

The exact answer is because I am willing to learn. In terms of knowledge I feel the more the merrier. If the rate of creating increases at a certain pace the technologies created will get obselete within a span of 5 to 10 years, that rate of change is inevitable and the ones who are willing to learn can only take on that change. I don't believe in settling and that is exactly not what we are made for.
Apart from that I have exceptional coding skills, the required skills of a Computer Science Engineer and beyond.
